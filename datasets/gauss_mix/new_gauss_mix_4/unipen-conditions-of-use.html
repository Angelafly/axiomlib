<h1>UNIPEN Database Conditions of Use</h1>

The term <em>user</em> will refer to the person or institution who
has obtained the UNIPEN data distribution.
<p>
Two major types of use can be identified:

<h1>
<ul>
<li> I. Non-commercial use
<p>
<li> II. Commercial use
</ul>
</h1>

<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=10>
<tr><td>
I. Non-commercial use
<p>
Non-commercial use refers to university and institutional
research which aims at public dissemination of research results. This
type of usage of UNIPEN data is highly advocated by the International
Unipen Foundation (iUF). However, there is a 
<a href="#research-publication">Publication Policy</a> which must be
taken into account (See below).

<tr><td> 
II. Commercial use
<p>
II.a Commercial use of UNIPEN data proper - the textual content and the point 
coordinates - is prohibited. An example would be the extraction of 
handwriting coordinates to sell 'script fonts'. 
<p>
II.b The usage of UNIPEN data for the training of 
commercial handwriting recognition systems
is allowed. 
<p>
II.c The  <a href="iuf-unipen-tm.html">UNIPEN logo</a> will be presented by 
the user in the final documentation of the resulting software product. 
<p>
II.d Reference to individual writer identities or the identity of 
individual data donator companies from
within the UNIPEN data distribution should be avoided at all times.

</table>
<p>
<font size=-1>Note: Also in the case
of commercial development, the user is kindly asked to present the
results of the underlying research and development via an acknowledged
science &amp; technology forum (journal or conference).</font>

<h2><a name="research-publication">Ad I. UNIPEN Publication Policy</h2>

<h3>I.1 - Reference</h3>
Users are required to mention the Unipen Release version 
in their publications, and are strongly urged to use the latest  
version available.

<pre>
    Reference example: 

        "As a training set, we used UNIPEN [xx] Train-R01/V07, 
         <a href="#bench">benchmark</a> ..., subsets ..... 
         As a test set, we used UNIPEN DevTest-R01/V02, 
         benchmark ..., subsets .... 
         To the raw UNIPEN data, the following pre-processing 
         was applied: ...."
             .
             .
             .

             Liberman, M. & Janet, S. (1994). 
             UNIPEN project of on-line data exchange and recognizer 
             benchmarks, Proceedings of the 12th International

<p>
In this example we assume the release of the set DevTest-R01/V02,
which will actually take place in the future.
<p>
In case your training set and test set are derived from within a 
single distribution such as Train-R01/V07, please explain in detail
how your random selection of samples from within this distribution 
was produced. Was the process actually random? Was manual pruning
involved? Improvements to the labels (truth values) can be submitted 
by the users in the form of <kbd>.SEGMENT...</kbd> entries via <a
href="mailto:office@unipen.org">email</a> to the iUF.


<h3>I.2 - Which data?</h3>

A proper distinction between training and test sets is necessary.
The best possible training/test set distinction involves data randomly
selected from two exclusive sets of writers for both sets, respectively.
<p>
Note that there is a problem in the use of test sets. Iterated use
of a particular training / test set pair in a development process
can be considered as <b>indirect training</b>! Even if a development set
as such is not formally used for training, it is a well-known fact that 
all parameter adjustments,
code improvements, etc., are a form of training, regardless of the type
of pattern recognition algorithm which is used. Therefore, it is good
practice to explain the effort spent in iterated testing in the publications.
The tendency to iterate a single training/test set pair within a complete
PhD project has led to inflated reported recognition rates in the past.
It is good practice to generate a random selection of multiple sets at
the start of such projects.


<h3>I.3 - Benchmark (eq. database subset) overview</h3>

<p>
<center>
<a name="bench">
<table border=5 bgcolor="DDEEDD" cellpadding=1>
<tr><td> <b>Benchmark</b> <td> <b>Description</b>
<tr><td> <h2>1a <td> isolated digits
<tr><td> <h2>1b  <td> isolated upper case
<tr><td> <h2>1c  <td> isolated lower case
<tr><td> <h2>1d  <td> isolated symbols (punctuations etc.)
<tr><td> <h2>2   <td> isolated characters, mixed case
<tr><td> <h2>3   <td> isolated characters in the context of words or texts
<tr><td> <h2>4   <td> isolated printed words, not mixed with digits and symbols 
<tr><td> <h2>5   <td> isolated printed words, full character set
<tr><td> <h2>6   <td> isolated cursive or mixed-style words (without digits and symbols)
<tr><td> <h2>7   <td> isolated words, any style, full character set              
<tr><td> <h2>8   <td> text: (minimally two words of) free text, full character set
</table>
</center>

<p>
Note that only <b>Benchmark #8</b> is a realistic, application-oriented test,
because the word segmentation problem must also have been solved by
the recognizer. No manual word segmentation is allowed in test <b>Benchmark #8</b>.
